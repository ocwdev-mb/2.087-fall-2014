Course Description
------------------

This course is about the mathematics that is most widely used in the mechanical engineering core subjects: An introduction to linear algebra and ordinary differential equations (ODEs), including general numerical approaches to solving systems of equations. Topics covered include linear systems of equations, existence and uniqueness of solutions, Gaussian elimination. Initial value problems, 1st and 2nd order systems, forward and backward Euler, and the Runge-Kutta method (RK4). The course also covers eigenproblems: eigenvalues and eigenvectors, including complex numbers, functions, vectors and matrices. MATLAB{{< sup "®" >}} is used in this course.

Late Policy
-----------

It is expected that completed assignments will be submitted on the due date and time noted on the assignment. The usual policy for late assignments is that a letter grade is lost per day late. If no arrangement is made ahead of time, that is going to be adhered to strictly. The teaching staff is well aware of the multiple time demands on students. In the case of unusual circumstances or unavoidable conflicts, students discussed the details with the professor and explored alternatives before the due date.
